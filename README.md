# Tidal Hackathon
*Welcome to the Tidal Hackathon GitHub repository for Team 24.*

## Overview
*This repository contains all the resources, code, and data for our team's participation in the Tidal Hackathon 2023.
 We developed a basic application that asked the professor some quesitons, determine whether or not they are liked by their students, and what the 
 professor could improve on.*
**Debrief**
- We created a google form and ask people to fill in the survey in regard to their professor as our data.
- Using the new data set in csv format, we developed and trained an AI model to predict based on the questionaire that are given to the professor, if they are liked or not.
- We add the finishing touch to the project by creating a GUI with a questionaire and result page.
